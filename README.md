# Business Card Scanner Add-on

Welcome and thank you for installing the Business Card Scanner Add-on! This tool makes it easy to convert business cards into contacts on your Google Account.

This project is currently in the testing phase. If you're interested in becoming a tester, feel free to reach out!

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Launch the Add-on

You can open the Business Card Scanner in two ways:

- **From Gmail**  
  Open Gmail and look for the **Business Card Scanner** icon in the right-hand sidebar. Click it to launch the add-on.

- **Using a Direct Link**  
  [Click here to open the scanner](https://script.google.com/macros/s/XXXXXXXXXXXX/exec)  
  _Replace the URL above with your deployed Web App URL._

  > ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip:** For quick access on your phone, create a home screen shortcut:  
  > - **iPhone**: Open the link in Safari, tap the **Share** icon, and select **"Add to Home Screen."**  
  > - **Android**: Open the link in Chrome, tap the **three-dot menu**, and choose **"Add to Home screen."**

### 2. Authorize Access

The first time you launch the add-on, youâ€™ll be prompted to grant **Google account permissions**.

This authorization allows the add-on to:

- Upload and scan images for contact details and parse the data
- Autofill and submit contact details through the in-app form
- Create new contacts in your Google Contacts

> ðŸ”’ **Privacy Note:**  
> This app only uses the permissions necessary to perform the above functions.

### 3. Scan a Business Card

1. Click the **"Take or Upload a Business Card"** button.
2. Capture or select an image of the business card.
3. The add-on will:
   - Process the image using OCR
   - Extract contact details
   - Display an editable form directly within the app
4. Review and submit the form to save the contact to your Google Contacts.

> ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip:** Using a computer? You can scan email signatures too!  
> Use the **Snipping Tool** (Windows) or **Screenshot** shortcut (Mac) to capture contact information from an email signature, then upload the image to process it just like a business card.

---

### 4. Continue Scanning

You can scan additional cards anytime â€” just click the **"Scan Another Card"** button to reset the interface and start a new scan.


## Troubleshooting

- **Trigger Not Set Up?**  
  Ensure you clicked the **"Click here to enable contact creation"** link during the initial setup.

- **Contact Creation Issues?**  
  Verify that the initial setup has been completed. The add-on only creates contacts after the trigger is installed and the form is submitted.


Happy scanning!
