### 2. Authorize Access

The first time you launch the add-on, youâ€™ll be prompted to grant **Google account permissions**.

This authorization allows the add-on to:

- Upload and scan images to extract contact details
- Autofill and submit contact information through the in-app form
- Create new contacts in your Google Contacts

> ðŸ”’ **Privacy Note:**  
> The only action this app performs on your Google Account is the creation of a contact using the  
> `People.People.createContact(resource)` method from the **Google People API**.  
> External access is required solely to process the scanned image and structure the data into contact fields.  
> No information is shared outside your Google environment

### 3. Scan a Business Card

1. Click the **"Take or Upload a Business Card"** button.
2. Capture or select an image of the business card.
3. The add-on will:
   - Process the image using OCR
   - Extract contact details
   - Display an editable form directly within the app
4. Review and submit the form to save the contact to your Google Contacts.

> ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip:** Using a computer? You can scan email signatures too!  
> Use the **Snipping Tool** (Windows) or **Screenshot** shortcut (Mac) to capture contact information from an email signature, then upload the image to process it just like a business card.

### 4. Continue Scanning

You can scan additional cards anytime â€” just click the **"Scan Another Card"** button to reset the interface and start a new scan.


Happy scanning!
