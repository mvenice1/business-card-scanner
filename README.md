# Business Card Scanner Add-on

Welcome and thank you for installing the Business Card Scanner Add-on! This tool makes it easy to convert business cards into contacts on your Google Account.

## Getting Started

1. **Open the Add-on**  
   Launch the add-on from your Workspace app (for example, open Gmail and locate the Business Card Scanner in the sidebar).

2. **Initial Setup**  
   On the add-onâ€™s homepage, click the **"Click here to enable contact creation"** link. This one-time setup installs the trigger that allows the add-on to automatically create contacts in your Google Account when you use it.

3. **Scan a Business Card**  
   - Click the **"Take or Upload a Business Card"** label to capture or select an image.
   - The add-on will process the image, extract the card details, and open a prefilled Google Form.
   - Submit the form to add the contact to your Google Contacts.

4. **Continue Scanning**  
   Once set up, you can scan new cards anytime. To scan another card, simply click the **"Scan Another Card"** button to reset the interface.

## Troubleshooting

- **Trigger Not Set Up?**  
  Ensure you clicked the **"Click here to enable contact creation"** link during the initial setup.

- **Contact Creation Issues?**  
  Verify that the initial setup has been completed. The add-on only creates contacts after the trigger is installed and the form is submitted.


Happy scanning!
