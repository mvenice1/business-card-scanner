### 2. Initial Setup

On the add-on's homepage, click the **"Click here to enable contact creation"** link.

This one-time setup installs the trigger that allows the add-on to automatically create contacts in your Google Account when you submit a scanned business card.

### 3. Scan a Business Card

1. Click the **"Take or Upload a Business Card"** button.
2. Capture or select an image of the business card.
3. The add-on will:
   - Process the image
   - Extract contact details
   - Open a prefilled Google Form
4. Review and submit the form to create a new contact in your Google Contacts.

---

### 4. Continue Scanning

Once setup is complete, you can scan additional cards at any time.

Click the **"Scan Another Card"** button to reset the interface and start a new scan.

## Troubleshooting

- **Trigger Not Set Up?**  
  Ensure you clicked the **"Click here to enable contact creation"** link during the initial setup.

- **Contact Creation Issues?**  
  Verify that the initial setup has been completed. The add-on only creates contacts after the trigger is installed and the form is submitted.


Happy scanning!
